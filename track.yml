teaser: Debug issues in your K8s cluster with Pixie
description: |-
  ## Overview

  You’re the developer of TinyHat.me, a website and API for putting virtual hats on virtual heads that runs in kubernetes. But TinyHat has big problems. It’s time to instrument your cluster with Pixie and use it to find the source of your users’ frustrations.

  ## Objectives

  - Instrument your kubernetes cluster with New Relic + Pixie
  - Use PxL scripts in the Live Debugger to gather insights into your cluster’s behaviors
  - Find the root cause of two bugs in your software

  ## Requirements

  - A free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup?utm_source=developer-site)

  ## Important Note

  _This track utilizes an ephemeral virtual machine. As a result, finish the entire track in one sitting or you'll lose your progress when time expires._

    Your website, TinyHat.me, runs in kubernetes. In the **Shell** tab, explore the pods that make up your application:

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    > **Note:** All your pods should be running by now, but if they're not, give them a few more minutes.

    Here, you can see ten containerized services, each with their own pod:

    - admin
    - add
    - moderate
    - svclb-gateway
    - frontend
    - upload
    - gateway
    - mysql
    - manipulation
    - fetch

    Instead of going into detail about these services now, you'll learn about them in context as you walk through this lab's scenarios.

    Explore your services next:

    ```
    kubectl get services
    ```

    Here, you can see your kubernetes services. Notice that most of your app services has a corresponding kubernetes service. One of these services is particularly important: frontend-service. This is a NodePort service that you connect to when you view your site.

    ## Try out your site

    1. Switch to the **Frontend** tab to see your application
    2. Select a number of hats to display and a hat type
    3. Select **Hat Me**

    Now Bob Ross is wearing the hat(s) that you selected. Cool, right?

    Switch to the **Admin** tab and approve the pending hat submissions. For each one, you're redirected to a new tab or window with a successful JSON response.

    It's critical that you moderate hats for your site so users don't upload inapproriate images. TinyHat.me is a family-friendly site, after all!

      Pixie is an open source, state of the art Kubernetes monitoring solution that provides:

      - **Automatic** and **instant** baseline observability of your cluster
      - Actionable, **code-level** insights of your applications
  - type: text
    contents: In minutes, auto-telemetry with Pixie provides dynamic data such as protocol traces, resource metrics, and app metrics from your cluster—without an agent!
  - type: text
    contents: With New Relic's Pixie integration, we've simplified this process even more by providing a guided installation of Pixie into your cluster.
  - type: text
    contents: If you haven't signed into [New Relic](one.newrelic.com), do that now so you're ready to install Pixie into your cluster.

    Click **Kubernetes** to let New Relic guide you through instrumenting your Kubernetes cluster:

    ![Arrow pointing to the Kubernetes button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic-experimental/kubernetes-observability-with-pixie/main/assets/kubernetes-install.png)

    Click **Begin installation**:

    ![Arrow pointing to the begin installation button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic-experimental/kubernetes-observability-with-pixie/main/assets/begin-installation.png)

    Select your account, name your cluster "tiny-hat", and click **Continue**:

    ![Box highlighting the account and cluster name fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic-experimental/kubernetes-observability-with-pixie/main/assets/account-and-cluster.png)

    Leave the default choices. These provide you with a range of observability features for your cluster. Notably, the default options include "Instant service-level insights, full-body requests, and application profiles through Pixie" which you'll focus on in this lab.

    Click **Continue**:
